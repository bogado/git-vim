= Testing

== Introduction
These unit tests are aimed at other developers.

They require runVimTests, a vim plugin available on the vim.org website.

Once runVimTests is installed, in the shell you can:
cd git-vim
runVimTests tests

It will run all the .vim files in the tests directory and gather the results
in a test harness, printing a summary.

You can also use the Makefile to run the tests.  To do that, just run:
make test

== Compatibility
These unit tests require Cygwin to run in Windows.  It's not for any
fundamental reason, just that they use some shell commands to create the
directory under git control.  If someone wanted to put in the effort, they
could be cross platform relatively easily.
